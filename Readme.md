###### Infinity complexes as a natural byproduct when defined within QCD. Generate sub-linear scattering. 

#### Lambda Field Encoding : Implies that these sub-linear scatterings
###### are, encoding channels bound to electrical resistance. Since we use scientific notation to define {space time}wave theorems.
