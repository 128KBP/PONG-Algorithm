###### Infinity complexes as a natural byproduct when defined within QCD. Generate sub-linear scattering. 

#### Lambda Field Encoding : Implies that these sub-linear scatterings
###### Are encoding channels, bound to electrical resistance. Since we use scientific notation to define space and time, wave theorems.

###### Integrating the planar of {Time} becomes highly abstracted. Within the scattering effects. To take a fragment of time, can be infitessimally small. And yet within that frame of reference infinitely long. Nucleotide functions can create hyperbolic wave functions of self referenced scattering at multiplexed points within time. For example : A singular organic rerence becomes many of the same instances. Within a scene so to speak. But becomes subject to the observer effect. 

##### And this implies : Where we might observe byproducts of relativistic effects. I:E Bose eisen features within QCD take place. Denoted by relativistic effects beyond  the internet or the point of origin.
